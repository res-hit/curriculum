\section*{Profile}
Master's Degree Student in Computer Science Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. My expertise focuses on software development lifecycle across mobile, frontend, and backend domains. I have collaborated with various student teams on application prototypes for different courses:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Mobile Application Development}: Developed a second-hand marketplace application for Android OS (2020)
\item \textbf{Projects and Laboratory on Communication Systems}: Implemented a frontend system for a Raspberry Pi-based totem device, featuring QR code validation for booking verification (2020)
\item \textbf{Web Applications 2}: Developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot framework for an e-commerce platform (2021)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Master Thesis - Detection of Personal Protective Equipment in Factory Settings: A Cloud-based Solution}: Developed a system for real-time video streaming to the cloud with ML-based detection of worker safety compliance. The solution comprises two components: a containerized gateway for video streaming and sensor data collection, and cloud-managed services for edge data processing (2022-2024).

\vspace{0.5ex}
During my thesis work, I gained foundational knowledge in machine learning, particularly in deep neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks and transformers. In early 2024, I was co-founding a startup focused on GenAI application development but stepped down due to misaligned vision and goals.
